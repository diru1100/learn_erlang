# erlang stuff

Random stuff I get to know about erlang 

- Learned about tail-recursion
    - It is better as modern compiler can do tail call elimination thus preventing useless func calls as function call is the last thing called.

    - [Tail Recursion - GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tail-recursion/)

- Records:
    - [https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/records.html](https://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/records.html)

- To run an erl program first, compile it using erlc, then a beam file is created. Now you can access it's functions in erl shell. ðŸ™‚
